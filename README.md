# BlinkSnap: Eye-Controlled Photography

## Overview
**BlinkSnap** is an innovative eye-controlled photography system that captures photos with a simple blink. Using eye-tracking technology, it enables hands-free photography, making it ideal for accessibility, surveillance, and smart wearables.

## Features
- **Hands-Free Operation**: Capture images with a blink.
- **Eye-Tracking Technology**: Detects intentional blinks for precise photo-taking.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use in various applications.
- **Accessibility**: Ideal for individuals with mobility impairments.
- **Integration**: Can be embedded into smart glasses and wearable devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning** (for blink detection)
- **Computer Vision** (for eye-tracking)
- **Python & OpenCV** (for image processing)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blinksnap.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
